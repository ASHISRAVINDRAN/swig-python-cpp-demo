# C++ and Python Interoperability Demo
This project demonstrates how to use SWIG and CMake to facilitate the passing of pointers between C++ and Python. It showcases the creation of Python bindings for a C++ Shape class, leveraging SWIG to manage the interface between the two languages.

## Prerequisites
* C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
* CMake (version 3.x or later)
* Python (version 3.9 or later)
* SWIG (version 4.x or later)
